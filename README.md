## Gainzlife

Gainzlife is the All-In-One lifestyle, fitness and health tracker built using React and Materialize. It implements FitBit's API to show statistics that are tracked using the user's FitBit device.

With the FitBit API users can see how well they are sleeping, resting heart rate, steps taken and calories burned.

The dashboard also helps you track calories consumed, daily habits and goals.
